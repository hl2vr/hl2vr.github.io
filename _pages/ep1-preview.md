Welcome! If you are reading this, you were probably given early access to our current Episode One VR build, to help us iron out a few bugs before launch and/or spread the word about the mod :)
Here are some important details for you, please go over them carefully.

### Important: select the "testing" branch!

After activating your Episode One VR Steam key and installing the game, please go to the game's Properties and under "Betas" select the "testing" branch. This will ensure you are on the latest build, as the default branch contains an older build missing many of the bug fixes and features we implemented in the last few weeks.

### Reporting on the mod

As with the HL2VR prerelease, there are no strings attached, no NDAs or embargoes. You are free to report on the mod in any form and at any time. That being said, we do appreciate if you communicate issues you faced to us, first.

If you do want to do us a favour, you can:
- link to the Steam store page: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2177750/HalfLife_2_VR_Mod__Episode_One/ - people wishlisting the mod help us by increasing its visibility on Steam
- link to our donations page: https://ko-fi.com/sourcevrmodteam

### Tips for recording

If you intend to record the screen mirror, note that the game's window by default uses a resolution of 720p. To get higher quality video, you may want to increase that resolution. You can do so by adding e.g. `-w 1920 -h 1080` to the game's launch options.

Furthermore, you might want to disable the game mirroring the HUD and menu to the window, as that will cause it to display double in your recording. To do so, open the console in-game via the button in the options menu, then type `hlvr_hud_on_mirror -1`. To revert this change, type `hlvr_hud_on_mirror 1`.

### New features

If it's been a while since you've played HL2VR, we have released a couple of QoL updates since its launch, and here are a few of the highlights you may have missed:

- all weapons are now flashed out in both their mechanics and animations. Additionally, missing muzzle flashes and ejected shells have been restored where appropriate.
- Support for bHaptics vests. If you got one, you might as well pull it from storage for your Episode One playthrough ;)

Furthermore, the test build contains a few features that have not yet been pushed to the base game (but will be available before the Ep1 release):

- Teleport movement. You can choose to either fully replace smooth locomotion with teleport, or only replace jump with teleport and use locomotion and teleport in combination.
- A first-time setup wizard to choose your movement and comfort preferences. You should see it when you first launch Episode One.
- New vehicle camera modes for added comfort. Not really relevant for Episode One, but I thought I'd mention it in case you revisit the base game, or just for the upcoming Episode Two :)

### Episode Two

We hope to have Episode Two ready soon after the release of Episode One. Our current goal is to release Episode Two on April 6th, just in time for Easter. However, this date is *not confirmed*, so please do make that clear if you want to report on it :)
You will receive keys for Episode Two early access in due time.
