*Half-Life 2 VR* is going to release as a public beta in September 2022. The game in its
current state is fully playable from start to finish, and all gameplay elements are
available to make this a great VR experience!

However, that does not mean that the project is finished, far from it. There is a lot left
to do, and with your help and support we hope to turn the game into the most amazing VR
title we possibly can, over time. Listed below are the major items we intend to work on after
the initial public beta release.

#### Episode support

The episodes require a separate build of the mod. This build needs to be prepared and properly
tested before it can be released public. Preliminary internal testing by the dev team has
already found a few major issues that need to be resolved. Even so, the majority of the episodes
already works very well in VR, and after the initial public beta launch we will strive to get
the episodes fully supported as soon as possible.

#### Weapon overhaul

All of the *Half-Life 2* weapons have been converted into VR and are fully functional, including
manual reloading, two-handed weapon handling and optional laser sights. However, there is still
a lot of polish left to do. Most of the weapons do not yet feature hand poses, some weapon
animations and effects are missing or incomplete, and some aspects of the weapon handling could
be improved. We are working on it and will gradually release updates as we make progress.

#### Movement and comfort improvements

The game currently features full support of roomscale movement as well as artificial locomotion
with all the typical configuration options you'd expect from a modern VR title: head- or controller-
oriented movement, snap and smooth turning and a configurable comfort vignette for those who are
struggling with motion sickness.

Even so, the controls could still benefit from some fine-tuning to make them feel even snappier.
We are also still investigating the possibility of teleport movement, although this is not a trivial
challenge since the game and its levels were not designed for it. We are also still investigating
further comfort improvements for the vehicle rides for those who need them.

#### Overhauled maps, assets and textures

18 years on, and *Half-Life 2* still holds up incredibly well as a game (in our opinion, anyway).
Even so, nobody can deny that a lot has happened to game graphics in that time, and the game does
show its age in some scenes more than others. Low-resolution meshes and textures are particularly
jarring in a VR headset.

While we certainly cannot "remaster" HL2 to look like a game developed in 2022, we are working on
overhauling assets and textures by a combination of AI upscaling and manual touches to give them
that extra bit of detail and sharpness under the VR headset that is missing from the original. All
updates are intended to stay faithful to the original. Additionally, all maps in the game will
get a facelift and are being improved with updated lighting, more details and bug fixes in addition
to VR-centric adjustments like smooth stairs.

These updates are not quite ready for prime-time, yet, so the initial public beta will launch with
stock HL2 assets. But we do intend to make these upgrades available over time, as an optional download.
In the meantime you are, of course, free to play with existing texture update mods if you like.
