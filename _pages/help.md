Do you need help playing Half-Life 2 in VR? Do you have questions about the VR modification,
or did you encounter a bug? Let us help you!

<br />

## Need help? Start here!

First, have a look at our [FAQ](/faq/) - it might just be your question has already been
answered there.

If you need help with the controls, e.g. you can't figure out how to climb ladders or reload
your guns, we have a [Manual](/manual/) that explains the VR controls in-depth. So check it out!

Are you a modder and want to upload your own content to the HL2VR Steam workshop? If so,
we have a [Workshop guide](/workshop/) available for you.

<br />

## Known (major) issues

If you're struggling with something game-breaking, like being unable to install the game, or a
crash to desktop when trying to launch it, check the [Known Issues](/knownissues/) page first.

This is (intentionally!) an incomplete list.
It’s being updated over time, and only covers the biggest game-breaking issues we’ve come across.
It does not include smaller bugs or feedback on the game. (Those have a place too - see below!)

<br />

## Reporting bugs

*Half-Life 2: VR Mod* is currently in beta. As a consequence, you are bound to encounter a couple
instances of broken stuff or rough edges. Our apologies! We would appreciate it if you could leave us a
bug report on our [Bug Tracker](https://feedback.halflife2vr.com) with as much detail as you
can remember about what happened, where it happened and what you were doing at the time. Do
have a quick look at the previously reported bugs, though - perhaps your issue is already there,
in which case you can just upvote it. That helps us identify the most common issues and prioritize
them accordingly!

If the game crashes, a crash dump will be stored in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\dumps` with
a file name like `crash_hl2.exe_20220916150500_1.dmp`.
If you can provide this dump to the team, we can use it to pinpoint the cause of the crash.
