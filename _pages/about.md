*Half-Life 2: VR* is a third-party mod for the 2004 PC gaming classic by Valve Software.
It is being developed by the Source VR Mod Team and will be released free of charge on
Steam to owners of Half-Life 2.

*Half-Life 2: VR* was originally greenlit on Steam back in 2017. It has since gone through
its own kind of development hell and was all but abandoned. In July 2021, a new influx of
team members has revitalized the project, and as of September 2022 it has been released
to the public.

*Half-Life 2: VR* is a mod and is not created by or affiliated to Valve Software.
