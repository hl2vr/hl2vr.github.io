<br />

This page contains a few brief guides on how to accomplish things that aren't specific to HL2VR itself (such as changes to Steam or SteamVR settings).
Generally speaking, this means the SourceVR Mod Team doesn't have direct control over how these things work.
This is just meant to be helpful!
