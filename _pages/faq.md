*Who is developing Half-Life 2: VR?*

The mod is being developed by the Source VR Mod Team, a group of VR enthusiasts.
See also [About](/about/).

---

*How much will it cost?*

The mod will be available free of charge. You do need to own the base game Half-Life 2
on Steam.

---

*When will it be available?*

"Soon". The mod is currently undergoing a closed playtest. We are targeting a 2022
public release, fingers crossed!

---

*What headsets are supported?*

The mod is targeting SteamVR, so any headset supported by SteamVR should be good to go.
So far, the mod has been successfully tested on Index, Quest, Vive and Pimax headsets.

---

*What movement options are available?*

The mod features smooth locomotion, where the direction of motion can be configured to
either follow your head or any of the two controllers. Turning can be configured to be
either smooth or in fixed intervals (snap turns).

There is currently no teleport movement available, and it is unclear if it will
become a viable option in the future.

---

*Is left-handed mode supported?*

Yes! You can configure the dominant hand, which determines the hand that is holding
weapons. It will also swap the control scheme accordingly, so that by default movement
is on the off hand whereas turning is on the primary hand. If you would like to hold
your weapons in the left hand while still moving with the left stick, you will have the
option to configure a custom SteamVR controller binding to make that happen.

*How will you handle the vehicle sections? I don't think I can stomach them in VR.*

Right now, the vehicle rides do indeed require strong VR legs. However, we intend to
offer various options to make them more comfortable, ranging from a simple
motion-triggered vignette to putting vehicle rides on a virtual 2D screen, so that
everyone has a chance to get through them at the level of (dis-)comfort they can handle.
