# Difficulty

---

The standard Easy, Medium, and Hard options are available.  
Players may want to keep in mind that the game will "feel" much more difficult than the
base game, and adjust their desired difficulty accordingly.

<br />

### Laser Pointer for weapons

A laser pointer can be enabled to make aiming weapons easier.  
Enabling this option does not affect any other gameplay.

<br />

### Quick Reload

This option is available to simplify the reloading process. (See the [Controls section](#controls)
for more detail on the default manual reloading procedure.)  
When Quick Reload is enabled, a player can press the [Eject Magazine button](#controls) then drop their
weapon hand to their waist, pointed down to the ground.
After a moment, the weapon will automatically reload the relevant ammo.

<br />

---

# Controls

---

The controls are fully customizable via SteamVR's controller bindings. Below we will
explain the default bindings, but you can always make your own modifications to suit your needs,
or use community bindings another user has created and shared.

<br />

### Default Controls

*Half-Life 2: VR Mod* aims to support both right- and left-handed players. If you change the
primary hand, all controls will be swapped accordingly.  
For example, if you enable left-handed mode, then you will hold weapons in your left hand and move with the right stick.
If you still want movement to be on the left stick, you will have to customize the SteamVR controller bindings.

**The guide below will assume that the right hand is the primary hand and the left hand the off hand.**

<br />

### Dominant Hand

Use this option to select your primary hand. By default, this is set to right hand.

<br />

### Movement and movement direction

The left (off-hand) stick controls your movement through the world. Press the stick in
to activate Sprint; Sprint will remain active until you fully let go of the stick again.
(Users with capacitive controllers, such as the Quest and Index, may need to briefly remove their thumb
from the stick as well.)

You can freely move around in the real world. Your roomscale position will be reflected in the game.

There is currently no teleport movement option available, and it's unknown if it will come in a
future update. For now, you can active a motion vignette in the [Comfort options](#comfort-options) if you need it.

You can artificially turn with the right (primary hand) stick. By default, snap turn is active with a 30Â°
turn amount. You can change the turn amount using the "Snap turn degrees" setting in the Controls options.  
Setting this to 0 will enable continuous smooth turning.

Toggle crouch by moving the right stick down. You can also physically crouch in real life.

Jump by moving the right stick up. Jumping in real life is not recommended.

<br />

### World interactions and Item pickup mode

You can grab items in each hand by pressing the Grip button (or squeezing the Index controllers).
Release Grip to let go. Grabbable items will be highlighted in the world when you are close enough
to pick them up.

By default, you need to pick up consumables like health or battery packs and weapons
to consume them. If you prefer the automatic pickup from the flat game, you can change this in
the Options menu.

The trigger on each controller is your "Use" key. Use it to interact with buttons, levers, NPCs,
doors, and more. Your hand needs to be close to your interaction target.

<br />

### Ladders

By default, "immersive" ladder climbing is active. Grab the ladder by squeezing your Grip buttons
to climb the ladder. You will need to unequip your weapon if you wish to climb with two hands.

To dismount a ladder: When you are at the top, look towards where you want to dismount,
then release the Grip button on the controller (or both controllers).  
Users may need to climb slightly higher than they are used to in the flat game; Gordon's legs
are not visible but he'll still need to get them above the dismount point to stand on it. :-)

If you prefer stick-based ladder climbing (similar to the flat game), you can enable this in
the [Comfort options](#comfort-options).

<br />

### Flashlight

You can activate and deactivate your flashlight by pressing either controller's Trigger near or in front of
your head.  
Users with inside-out tracking may have better luck activating this near the front of the head
where the controller is more easily tracked.

<br />

### Vehicles

To enter a vehicle, press either hand's trigger (while not holding anything) near the vehicle.

You can accelerate and steer your vehicles with the left (off-hand) stick. Press the left stick in to activate
the jeep's boost. The right A button activates the jeep's handbrake.

If the vehicle is equipped with a weapon, use your primary hand to aim the weapon and press the trigger
to fire it. If available, you can activate alt fire via the right B button.  
Use the "Vehicle weapon aim" option to change this from main hand to head or primary-hand tracking.

Pressing the right stick in activates the airboat's headlights.

To exit the vehicle, press the left controller (off-hand) A or X button.

<br />

# Weapons

---

HL2VR is designed to feel close to a native VR title, and weapon handling has been updated accordingly.

<br />

### Weapon selection and firing

Press and hold the right stick (or right touchpad on Index controllers) to open the weapon selection menu.
The available weapons are shown in a hexagonal grid. Move your right hand towards the icon of the
weapon you want to equip, then let go of the right stick to close the menu.  

The weapon selection menu is controlled by your hand's *position*; it is not a pointer.  
It may take some practice, but the menu is designed so that you can quickly switch to your desired weapons blind,
so allow yourself some time to build the necessary muscle memory! :-)

Once equipped, aim the weapon with your primary hand. Pull the trigger to fire the weapon.
Some weapons have an alt-fire mode which is activated by pressing the right B key.

<br />

### Reloading

To reload weapons, first press the right A button to eject the magazine (if applicable). If there is ammo
left in the magazine, it will automatically be recovered into your inventory.

Press and hold your off hand's Grip button near your shoulder to grab a fresh magazine.

Bring the new magazine close to the weapon's insert point, and the magazine will be loaded.  
Each weapon's insert point is unique. They are also subject to change during HL2VR's beta period.

<br />

### Melee attacks

To attack with the crowbar, you need to physically swing it to damage enemies or crates.

Swinging props or weapons other than the crowbar does not currently do any damage.
(But that may change in a future update.)

<br />

### Two-handing weapons and recoil control

Some weapons - including the SMG, pulse rifle, shotgun, and crossbow - can be held with both hands.
When the weapon is equipped, move your off hand near the handle or grab point, and press and hold the Grip button to
hold onto the weapon with your secondary hand.  
Holding these in both hands reduces recoil significantly, and is the intended way to use the weapon.

When using the shotgun, you will have to pump it after every shot. To do so, you need to grip it with both hands,
then pull in your secondary hand towards your primary hand and release it again.

To throw grenades or bugbait, press and hold the Trigger of your primary hand to arm the grenade.
Then make a physical throwing motion with your controller and let go of the trigger at the end
to throw the grenade.  
It can be challenging to accurately aim a grenade throw. Press and hold the alt-fire button to enable an alternative
throw mode. You will be presented with a visual arc that you can use to aim your throw.
Release the button to throw the grenade along the arc.  
(This is not available for bugbait, as that button is already bound to its usual alt-fire.)

# Comfort options

---

We've incorporated a variety of comfort options to help more players experience HL2VR.
More may be included in the future.

<br />

### Movement vignette

A standard movement vignette is available.  
While moving, the borders of your screen will be blackened, reducing your field of view
and reducing the impact of the motion sickness.

<br />

### Seated mode

This mode fixes Gordon's in-game height to match the base game regardless of the player's headset position.

<br />

### Vehicle mode

By default, "fixed horizon" is enabled. This allows your view to move with the vehicle, but disables any
view rolling. (This means you can be moved around, but you always remain upright.)

The "base game default" mode is available for roller coaster enthusiasts.

The "3rd person camera" changes the vehicle rides to a 3rd person camera perspective.
In this mode, the camera follows the vehicle at a distance and is not directly subjected to
the vehicle's rapid movements and turns, which should reduce motion sickness dramatically.
It does, however, make controlling the vehicles a little more awkward.

In the future, we may implement an additional mode where the vehicle rides are put
on a virtual 2D screen in front of the user, so that everyone has a chance to get through
the vehicle sections in the game. (This mode would of course be less immersive than the
current ones, as it would remove any 3D effect from the experience.)

<br />

### Vehicle entry/exit mode

By default, a short animation plays when entering and exiting a vehicle. This option replaces the
animation with a short fade to black.

<br />

### World scale

Players uncomfortable with the standard world scale can adjust it to be larger or smaller.

<br />

# Performance

---

HL2VR's overall performance relies *heavily* on your CPU's single-thread performance. Users with older
or low-end CPUs may have a harder than expected time running at their target resolution and framerate.
It cannot be optimized like modern games.
(And, of course, higher framerate targets will have higher requirements.)

Users should aim to have *at least* a mid-range Intel 6th gen or Ryzen 2000 series CPU.
At least mid-range Intel 8th gen or Ryzen 3000 are recommended,
and mid-range Intel 10th gen or Ryzen 5000 are ideal.
*Generally* speaking, low-end models in most CPU generations may still
struggle due to lower clock speeds (especially on older architectures).

Water reflections can be disabled, but it has a fairly minimal performance impact. 
Users with old/slow CPUs will benefit more from disabling this option.

On the GPU side it is notably more demanding than the base HL2, but it is still a game from 2004.
We have had very few complaints about GPU requirements. :-)

Users with at least GTX 1060 6GB, GTX 1660, or RX 580 performance on this "GPU hierarchy" list
should have little trouble with performance:  
https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gpu-hierarchy,4388.html

MSAA is available for anti-aliasing. This can be taxing on your GPU, so set accordingly.
4x is a good compromise.

Of course, your SteamVR resolution scaling will also have an effect on performance.

<br />

# Developer options

---

To enable the console, open the Options menu and select the console button in the bottom left corner.

To enable the developer menu, add '-vrdev' to the launch options in Steam. This will enable a special
developer panel in the options menu where you can jump to any map, give yourself any weapon, and a number of
other options and cheats.

*Note*: Using '-console' or '-dev' will prevent the main menu from showing in the headset! You
have to actually load into a level first before you will get anything to show in your HMD.
