Good news! All weapons are now functional in VR, meaning that the entire game can be
completed, in theory.

This doesn't mean that the weapons are perfect; we are still refining their VR mechanics
and are also planning to update the models and add hand poses, which are currently
missing.

Even so, it is a great milestone and puts us ever closer to an initial public release.

Developer cabalistic has also put up footage from his test playthrough of Sand Traps
and Nova Prospect:
