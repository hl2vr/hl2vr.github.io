A few of our Youtuber friends had the possibility to take a look at the current
state of the mod. Here are their impressions.

[Beardo Benjo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSzUG-hFZgaKpYA6w2WS8sQ)
calls it the "best VR mod of 2022".

We are delighted and relieved over these early reviews and are working hard on
getting the game into everyone's hands! Stay tuned. The wait is coming to an end :)
