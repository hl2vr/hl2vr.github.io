Unlike last year, it appears that Valve is allowing mods to be nominated for the Steam Awards 2023.
Therefore, we ask for your support in nominating Half-Life 2 VR at the Steam Awards!

You can nominate Half-Life 2 VR for the "Labor of Love" award [here](https://steamcommunity.com/games/658920/announcements/detail/3891734982319032033).

And you can nominate HL2VR Episode Two for the "VR Game of the Year" award [here](https://steamcommunity.com/games/2177760/announcements/detail/3898490381762137349).

Thanks for your support!


Have fun!
