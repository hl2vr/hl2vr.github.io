Good news, everyone! The wait is nearly over - the *Half-Life 2: VR* public beta is launching in September.
And yes, we do mean this year :)

{% include video provider="youtube" id="q-08KCheaGg" %}

A project as large and ambitious as *Half-Life 2: VR* is never truly finished. There is a lot that we
still want to do, and still want to improve on, to make it the best VR experience we possibly can.
You can find the most important areas we are still working on in our [Roadmap](/roadmap/).

However, the overwhelmingly positive feedback from our private beta testers over the past few weeks has
convinced us that the game as it is now can not only be fully completed from start to finish, but it's also
very enjoyable to do so, and we wish to give you the opportunity to experience it for yourselves. So go
and retrieve your crowbars from storage, and we will see you soon!

We do not have an exact release date yet, and will update you when we do, but it will likely be a Friday.
The mod itself will be free of charge, but you do need to own a copy of the original *Half-Life 2* on
Steam.

Unfortunately, at this point in time, we do not know if the initial public release will happen on Steam.
We are still waiting for approval by Valve, and we do not know how much longer that will take.
If our Store page gets approved by September, we will launch on Steam as planned. If not, we will
prepare an alternative launch outside of Steam. Either way, we are excited to have you play the mod in
September!
