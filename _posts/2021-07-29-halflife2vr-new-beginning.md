A few years ago, Valve greenlit the Half Life 2 VR mod project (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=923491647,) gave the team access to the game's full low level source code and other resources. Sadly, after a bit of work was done, the lead developer was hired by Rockstar and the project was left to mostly die. ðŸ˜¢  WormSlayer continued to work on maps to add next gen-like lighting and other features to them, but the project mostly stopped for the past few years without a developer.

A couple weeks ago, DrBeef and cabalistic stepped up to see how we could revitalize the project and get it out the door. The goal has been to make sense of the existing work the previous team had done and to polish it enough to get an initial version released to the public as soon as possible. Stay tuned for further developments!
