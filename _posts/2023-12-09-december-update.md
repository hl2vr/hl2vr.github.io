A new update has been released for Half-Life 2 VR and the episodes. With this update, your hands now physically collide with the environment and can no longer pass through walls. We've also added support for the ProVolver haptic pistol and updated our dxvk build to address potential stutters experienced on AMD cards.

For the full changelog, head over to the [Steam announcement](https://steamcommunity.com/games/658920/announcements/detail/3890610441350937985)!


Have fun!
