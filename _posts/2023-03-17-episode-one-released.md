Hello everyone,

since the release of *Half-Life 2: VR Mod*, we have been hard at work behind the scenes to bring the episodes to VR, as well. Today, we can finally bring you Episode One, and we hope you will enjoy the experience as much as we enjoyed preparing it for you!

So, without further ado, go ahead and [download Episode One for VR](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2177750/HalfLife_2_VR_Mod__Episode_One/). You need to own (but not install) the original [Episode One](https://store.steampowered.com/app/380/HalfLife_2_Episode_One/); in case you do not, now is a great time to buy it as it is heavily discounted thanks to the Steam Spring Sale. In fact, you might want to grab the Orange Box or the Valve Complete Collection to, well, complete your collection while you are at it! :)

And once you have completed Episode One, you will be pleased to know that the VR Mod for Episode Two is not far behind and will release on April 6th, just in time for the Easter weekend. Go ahead and [wishlist it now](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2177760/HalfLife_2_VR_Mod__Episode_Two/)!

Have fun!
