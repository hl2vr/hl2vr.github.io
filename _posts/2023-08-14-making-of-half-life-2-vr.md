Last month, our lead developer cabalistic gave a presentation on the making of Half-Life 2 VR at
the [Big Techday 23](https://www.bigtechday.com/en/talks#3xtVtGzo76UzSm5bXp3ftD) in Munich.

If you are interested in some background on the (long) history of the mod and how we approached
turning a classic flatscreen game in VR, there is a recording available on Youtube for you to watch:
