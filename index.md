*Rise and shine, Mr Freeman. Riseâ€¦ and shine.*

Half Life 2: VR is a third-party mod for the 2004 PC gaming classic by Valve Software. It allows players to experience the world of Half Life 2 in virtual reality.

Coming "soon" to Steam, free to all owners of Half-Life 2.

The mod is currently going through a private playtest and expected to be publically
released some time later this year.

Here you can watch some actual footage recorded by our Youtube friends:

Our developer cabalistic also did his own test playthrough of the entire game. Some
excerpts of these can be seen below. Note that those playthroughs were recorded on partly
older builds, so some of the issues visible in the build are already fixed :)
